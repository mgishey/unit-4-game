# unit-4-game

This game is called Crystal Collector where HTML values are dynamically updated using jQuery.

The game begins with a randomly generated computer score ranging between 19 and 120. Four crystals are assigned randomly generated values ranging between 1 and 12.  These values remain constant for each crystal unitil the game is won or lost. To win the game the player must match the score of the computer. A loss is registered anytime the user exceeds the score of the computer.

The value of each crystal is hidden from the user so the user must rely on memory to correctly pick the sum of the crystals clicked in order to match the computer score.
